# WondeX 🛡️

A Discord **Moderation, Security & Ticket** bot built in Python and hosted **for free** using GitHub Actions.

Developed by **wantedpebkkk** — created because many servers lack proper security and moderation tools.

## 🚀 Free Hosting on GitHub (no VPS needed)

The bot runs inside **GitHub Actions**, which is completely free for public repositories and gives you 2,000 free minutes/month on private repos. A scheduled workflow restarts the bot every 6 hours to stay within GitHub's job time limit.

### Step 1 — Fork this repository

Click **Fork** at the top-right of this page so you own a copy.

### Step 2 — Create your Discord bot

1. Go to <https://discord.com/developers/applications> and create a new application.
2. Navigate to **Bot** → click **Add Bot**.
3. Copy the **Token** (keep it secret!).
4. Under **OAuth2 → URL Generator** select the `bot` scope and the permissions you need, then invite the bot to your server.

### Step 3 — Add your token to GitHub Secrets

1. In your forked repository go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.
2. Click **New repository secret**.
3. Name it exactly `DISCORD_TOKEN` and paste your bot token as the value.
4. Click **Add secret**.

### Step 4 — Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to the **Actions** tab of your fork.
2. If prompted, click **I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them**.
3. Click on **Run WondeX Discord Bot** → **Run workflow** to start the bot immediately.

The workflow also runs automatically every 6 hours via a cron schedule, and an **auto-restart** workflow immediately re-launches the bot the moment a run ends — so downtime between restarts is near zero.

## 🌐 Keeping the bot truly 24/7 (UptimeRobot)

The bot runs a tiny Flask web server on port 8080 (`keep_alive.py`).  
To prevent any platform from suspending the process, set up a **free uptime monitor** to ping it every 5 minutes:

1. Sign up at <https://uptimerobot.com> (free tier is enough).
2. Click **+ Add New Monitor**.
3. Choose **HTTP(s)** as the monitor type.
4. Set the **URL** to the public address of your running bot (e.g. the GitHub Codespace / ngrok URL, or a self-hosted URL).
5. Set **Monitoring Interval** to **5 minutes**.
6. Save — UptimeRobot will now ping `GET /` every 5 minutes and alert you if the bot goes down.

## ⚠️ Security Notes

- **Never** commit your bot token to git. Always use GitHub Secrets.
- The `.gitignore` file already excludes `.env` to protect local tokens.
- Rotate your token immediately at <https://discord.com/developers/applications> if you accidentally expose it.
